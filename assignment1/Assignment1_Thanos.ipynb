    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the main advantages of CBOW and Skipgram?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "General pros:\n",
    "It preserves the semantic relationship between words. i.e man and woman tend to be closer than man and apple.\n",
    "It uses factorization which is a well-defined problem and can be efficiently solved.\n",
    "It has to be computed once and can be used anytime once computed. \n",
    "\n",
    "CBOW:\n",
    "-It is low on memory. It does not need to have huge RAM requirements like that of co-occurrence matrix where it needs to store -three huge matrices.\n",
    "-CBOW is faster to train and works well with frequent words\n",
    "\n",
    "skipgram:\n",
    "-Skip-gram model can capture two semantics for a single word. i.e it will have two vector representations of Apple. One for the company and other for the fruit.\n",
    "-Skip-Gram is more efficient with small training data\n",
    "-infrequent words are well presented\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------Difference-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that CBOW is learning to predict the word based on the context. We can simply \"translate\" that as maximizing the probability of the target word by looking at the context. This is why CBOW works better with frequent words but not the same happens for rare words. For example, given the context \"yesterday was really [...] day\" CBOW model will tell us that most probably the word is \"beautiful\" or \"nice\", which are quite usually used words. Words like \"delightful\" on the other hand will get much less attention of the model, because it is designed to predict the most probable word. This word will be smoothed over a lot of examples with more frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the skip-gram is designed to predict the context based on the target word. Given the word \"delightful\" it must study it and tell us, that there is huge probability, the context is \"yesterday was really [...] day\", or some other relevant context. With skip-gram the word delightful will not try to compete with word beautiful but instead, delightful+context pairs will be treated as new observations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the advantage of negative sampling?\n",
    "Negative sampling tends to work better for frequent words and better with low dimensional vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize performance for appropriate data (frequent words,small data sets) we would use CBOW with negative sampling \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative sampling is a way to sample the training data, similar to stochastic gradient descent, but the key is you look for negative training examples. Intuitively, it trains based on sampling places it might have expected a word, but didn't find one, which is faster than training an entire corpus every iteration and makes sense for common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative sampling is developed based on noise contrastive estimation and randomly samples the words not in the context to distinguish the observed data from the artificially generated random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the main drawbacks of CBOW and Skipgram?\n",
    "\n",
    "-CBOW takes the average of the context of a word (as seen above in calculation of hidden activation). For example, Apple can be both a fruit and a company but CBOW takes an average of both the contexts and places it in between a cluster for fruits and companies.\n",
    "-Training a CBOW from scratch can take forever if not properly optimized\n",
    "\n",
    "Skipgram takes a substantially larger amount of time since rather than averaging the context words, each context word is used as a pairwise training example. That is, in place of one CBOW example such as [predict 'ate' from average('The', 'cat', 'the', 'mouse')], the network is presented with four skip-gram examples [predict 'ate' from 'The'], [predict 'ate' from 'cat'], [predict 'ate' from 'the'], [predict 'ate' from 'mouse']\n",
